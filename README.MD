**Non Thread Safe Smart Pointer**  
this repository is for the implementations of non-thread-safe smart pointers.  
  
**features:**  
1. because of non-thread-safe, it will work fast.
2. these are formatted like STL smart pointers, thus these will replace STL ones easily.
3. running with single header file.
4. can be compiled on c++17 or later.

but these don't have functions as many as STL yet. basic functions only.  
for usage, please see [tests.cpp](./tests.cpp).
